```{r}
# uploading data to test read.csv vs. read.table
T1 <- read.csv("/Users/Tiana/Desktop/adult.csv", header = FALSE)
T2 <- read.table("/Users/Tiana/Desktop/adult.txt")

head(T1)
head(T2)

dim(T1)
dim(T2)
```
We should use read.csv funciton since the read.table combines columns


```{r}
census_adult_df <- read.csv("/Users/Tiana/Desktop/adult.csv", header = FALSE, col.names = ("age","workclass","worked","fnlwgt","education","marital-status","occupation","relationship",""))

```
